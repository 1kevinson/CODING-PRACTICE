# LeetCode JavaScript Practice

This project serves as a template for practicing LeetCode algorithms using JavaScript with ES2023 features, on the client side.

## Structure

- `/src`: Contains the JavaScript source files, where you'll implement your solutions.
  - `index.html`: The entry point HTML file linking to the JavaScript modules.
  - `app.js`: An example JavaScript module.
- `/tests`: Contains Jest unit tests for the practice algorithms implemented in the `/src` directory.
  - `app.test.js`: An example unit test for functions defined in `app.js`.

## How to Use

1. Implement your LeetCode solutions in the `/src` directory.
2. Write unit tests for your solutions in the `/tests` directory.
3. Run tests using Jest with the command: `npm test`.

This setup allows for practicing coding problems with a focus on modern JavaScript features and testing-driven development.

Happy coding!
